Create a script named ch7_course.py

Create a class called TrainingCourse that models a training course as follows:

A training course will contain the following data attributes: 

title, duration, pricePerPerson, and an ( initially empty) list called delegates. 
 
A training course will include a method (called add_delegate) that will accept a delegate
name as a parameter and then append it to the delegates list i.e. delegates.append(name) 

A training course will include a method ( called getTotalRevenue ) which will return 
the total revenue generated by the training course .i.e. number of delegates * pricePerPerson

Test the TrainingCourse class as follows:

Create a training course object
Assign some delegates to it
Extract and print the total price
